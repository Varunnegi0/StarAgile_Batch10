Module: Linux Fundamentals

How Linux is helpful for DevOps Engineers (Software Engineers)?
	- Windows OS is not recommended to work in real-time, because it has some security concerns

Linux is an OS

=> What is an OS?
	- OS is a software which is used to interact with the machine (Laptop/Mobile/VM/Physical Server)
	- It acts as a mediator between the user and the machine
	- OS is mandatory to use any device
	- It provides an environment to run applications

=> Types of OS
	- Windows, MacOS, Andriod, Linux, Ubuntu...

=> Why software engineers prefer working with Linux OS?
Windows Vs Linux

Windows is premium
Linux is free and open source

Window OS is single user based OS
Linux is multi user based OS

Windows OS doesn't have better security features
Linux OS is fully safe and secure

Windows OS is recommended for personal use
Linux OS is for professional use

Windows OS is developed and owned by Microsoft Organization
Linux OS is developed by Linus Torvalds

Windows OS is GUI (Graphic User Interface) based
Linux OS is CLI (Command Line Interface) based

=> Linux Distributions
Biryani - Hyderabad Biryani

Bnglr - Hyd biryani
Chennai - Hyd biryani
Pune - Hyd biryani

A Linux distribution is an OS that is built on top of original Linux kernel
Different distributions are tailored for various use cases such as desktops, servers, embedded systems...
In AWS Cloud, most of these distributions are available as AMI (Amazon Machine Image)

1. RPM based (RedHat Package Manager)
	- RedHat
	- CentOS
	- Amazon Linux 2023

2. Debian
	- Suse
	- Ubuntu

=> Linux Architecture
Shell
Kernel
Hardware Components

=> Launching EC2 instance and connecting with it;
	AWS ----> EC2 ----> AMI: Amazon Linux 2023, Keypair: , Network: Default VPC, SG: New SG, EBS: 30 GB ----> Launch the instance

To connect with the instance, we will use MobaXTerm

Username for Linux AMIs ----> ec2-user
Username for Ubuntu AMIs ----> ubuntu

=> Linux Commands - Part 1

To see the present month
cal (or) cal -1

To see the calendar of a specific year
cal <YearName>

To see the calendar of a specific month in a specific year
cal <MonthName> <YearName>

To see the present month, previous month and next month
cal -3

To see the date, day, month, year and time
date

Note: All servers in cloud will follow UTC time zone
UTC - Universal Coordinated Timezone

To clear the screen
clear (or) control + l

To see which flavor and OS is being used
cat /etc/os-release

To see the current working location
pwd (Present Working Directory)'

To know the information about a command
man <CommandName>

To know in which path the commands are available
which <CommandName>

Linux Directory Structure;
cd / ----> ls ----> You will see the default directory structure
bin  boot  dev  etc  home  lib  lib64  local  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var

To work with calculator
bc
To come out of the calculator ----> control + c

To install calculator ----> yum install bc -y

To see which user is using the OS
whoami

Types of users;
	1. ec2-user	----> limited permissions (you cannot install any softwares/packages)
	2. root		----> full permissions

Note: We can create custom users also

How to switch to root user?
sudo su (or) sudo -i

To logout from the root user
exit (or) control + d

Without switching to the root user, if we want to install any packages, we will add "sudo" in the beginning of the command. Which means, only for that command we are giving root user permissions

If you see $ symbol at the end of a line, it represents you are normal user
If you see # symbol at the end of a line, it represents you are root user

If you use "sudo -i" to switch to root user, we will be there in "/root" path
If you use "sudo su" to switch to root user, we will be there in "/home/ec2-user" path

The home location, when we connect to the ec2 instance is "/home/ec2-user"

To see from how long the VM is running
uptime

To see the history of commands executed
history

Full form of sudo ----> super user do

=> Creation and working with directories
In Linux everything is represented as a file or a directory (folder)

mkdir <DirectoryName>

To see the list of files and directories available in the current location
ls (list) or ls -l (long list) or ll (long list)

"ls" will only show the list of files and directories
"ls -l" or "ll" will show the metadata (information) of the files/directories

To go inside a directory
cd <DirName>

To move one step/directory backward
cd ..

To move multiple directories backward
cd ../... ---> two jumps backward
cd ../../.. ----> three jumps backwards

To delete an empty directory
rmdir <DirName>

To delete a directory and its subdirectories/files (non-empty directories)
rm -rf <DirName>

r - recursively
f - forcefully

While working with switching from one directory to another directory, we have two things;
	1. Absolute path	- it means we should give the complete path in a single command (Ex: cd /home/ec2-user/kastro)
	2. Relative path	- it means we need to go inside one specific directory (Ex: cd kastro, cd kiran, cd kk, cd Linux)

To see the list of files and directories in alphabetical order
ls (or) ll (or) ls -l

To see the list of files and directories in reverse alphabetical order
ls -lr

To display the latest files on top
ls -lt

To display the old files on latest
ls -ltr

To see the hidden files/directories
ls -al (or) ls -a

To create nested directories
mkdir -p parent/child1/child2/child3

To create multiple directories at a time
mkdir folder1 folder2 folder3 folder4
