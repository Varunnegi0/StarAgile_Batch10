GIT SQUASH
Squash means combining multiple commits in to a single commit

Paint a wall;
primer --- commit1
first coat --- commit2
second coat --- commit3

GIT CHECKOUT
To switch from old version of the file to latest version of file or vice-versa

Scenario 1: switching from one version to another version

f6c1bf6 (HEAD -> master) added version3		----> version3, version2, version1
369c960 added version2					----> version2, version1
b3dbbc7 added version1					----> version1

Scenario 2: Recovering a deleted file (when it is not committed)
git rm

4eb6ba3 (HEAD -> master) test file created
f6c1bf6 added version3

b3dbbc7 added version1

GIT RESTORE
Scenario 1: how to unstage a staged file (but not committed)
git reset kastro.txt
git restore --staged kastro.txt

Scenario 2: how to uncommit a committed file
git update-ref -d HEAD

Scenario 3: Uncommitting a particular commit

GIT STASH
Manager ----> Task 1: Create python file and add code in the file (10.00 AM) --------------------------------- Working..........
			Task 2: Create a new text file, add, commit (10.30 AM) --- This is a high priority task

When the tasks are partially completed, we can store the partially completed tasks in a temporary location by using GIT STASH

Note: Atleast 1 commit should be there to work with git stash command

Recovering a deleted file;

Scenario 1: deleted but not staged
 git restore hello.txt

Scenario 2: deleted and staged but not committed
git restore --staged hello.txt
git restore hello.txt

Scenario 3: deleted and committed
git restore --source=70067ba -- hello.txt

Scenario 4: if you don't know the file name
git log --diff-filter=D --summary
git checkout 70067ba -- hello.txt
